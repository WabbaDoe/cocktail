# Cocktail

A fun way to visualize drug interactions, based off of the [tripsit.me drug combinations chart](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Drug_combinations) 

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS

I'm not affiliated with trpsit.me, I just made this as a novel way to visualize their combination chart. 

The information on the site may be outdated. You can manually update datasets/combo_beta.json from [here](https://tripsit.me/combo_beta.json), but please be aware that their combination chart is only intended for as a quick reference for interactions between 2 substances, *not* as a guide for the complex interactions of 3 or more substances.

I don't endorse any of these drug combinations. Despite the name of the repo, DO NOT use this website as a guide for "drug cocktails" without doing much more research as these combinations will likely have unforeseen interactions.
